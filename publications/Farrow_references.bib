 title = {BEETLE {I}{I}: Deep Natural Language Understanding and Automatic Feedback Generation for Intelligent Tutoring in Basic Electricity and Electronics},
 author = {Dzikovska, Myroslava and Steinhauser, Natalie and Farrow, Elaine and Moore, Johanna and Campbell, Gwendolyn},
 abstract = {Within STEM domains, physics is considered to be one of the most difficult topics to master, in part because many of the underlying principles are counter-intuitive. Effective teaching methods rely on engaging the student in active experimentation and encouraging deep reasoning, often through the use of self-explanation. Supporting such instructional approaches poses a challenge for developers of Intelligent Tutoring Systems. We describe a system that addresses this challenge by teaching conceptual knowledge about basic electronics and electricity through guided experimentation with a circuit simulator and reflective dialogue to encourage effective self-explanation. The Basic Electricity and Electronics Tutorial Learning Environment (BEETLE II) advances the state of the art in dynamic adaptive feedback generation and natural language processing (NLP) by extending symbolic NLP techniques to support unrestricted student natural language input in the context of a dynamically changing simulation environment in a moderately complex domain. This allows contextually-appropriate feedback to be generated ``on the fly'' without requiring curriculum designers to anticipate possible student answers and manually author multiple feedback messages. We present the results of a system evaluation. Our curriculum is highly effective, achieving effect sizes of 1.72 when comparing pre- to post-test learning gains from our system to those of a no-training control group. However, we are unable to demonstrate that dynamically generated feedback is superior to a non-NLP feedback condition. Evaluation of interpretation quality demonstrates its link with instructional effectiveness, and provides directions for future research and development.},

 abstract = {We  present  an  experiment  aimed  at  improving interpretation robustness of a tutorial dialogue system that relies on detailed semantic interpretation  and  dynamic  natural  language feedback  generation.   We  show  that  we  can improve overall interpretation quality by combining  the  output  of  a  semantic  interpreter with  that  of  a  statistical  classifier  trained  on the subset of student utterances where semantic interpretation fails. This improves on a previous result which used a similar approach but trained the classifier on a substantially larger data set containing all student utterances.  Finally, we discuss how the labels from the statistical classifier can be integrated effectively with  the  dialogue  system’s  existing  error  recovery policies.},

 booktitle = {Poster presented at the 31st Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society},
 abstract = {Research suggests that students who are aware of their own confusions and take steps to resolve those confusions are most likely to benefit from a learning experience. At the same time, there are conversational maxims, such as Leech’s politeness maxims, that may inhibit a student from expressing and pursuing confusions within a tutorial dialogue. We investigated students’ expressions of confusion while working through a series of learning activities with a tutor. We found that, during the times when students were working independently on an activity, their expressions of confusion were reliable indicators of their (lack of) understanding; however, when they were conversing with their tutors, these same students did not express confusion and, in fact, the more often the expressed comprehension, the worse they performed on the post-test. This suggests that student metacognitive statements should not be interpreted without taking into consideration the context in which they were expressed. We briefly consider implications for human tutors and the development of computer tutoring systems.},
